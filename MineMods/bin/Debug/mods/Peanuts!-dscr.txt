Have you ever wanted to be a peanut farmer?
Do you want more types of food or just want to be able to make PBJ's in Minecraft?
Well, this small mod adds peanuts to Minecraft!

In this mod, you can find wild peanuts in the Jungle! Once you find them, you can break it and take them home to farm!
After you get the peanut farm going, you should find berries to make jelly!
Once you have your peanuts and jelly, you can combine them with bread to make PBJ's!
If you have any suggestions, please let me know! This tiny mod was originally made for me to get back into 1.14.4 modding.
